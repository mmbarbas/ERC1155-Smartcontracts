# ERC1155-Smartcontracts
Test of interaction between smartcontracts of the type ERC-1155

The purpose of this contracts is to create 3 types of NFTs:
 - The Mint pass and the Free Pass share the same contract. With them someone can claim an NFT from the second contract (a "Pack type NFT").
   The difference between this two is that with the Mint pass the user needs to pay for the claim of the Pack type NFT. Wiht the free pass the user can Mint a pack NFT for free
 - Pack NFT is minted only by who has the Miint pass or the free pass
 
 It still needs tests
